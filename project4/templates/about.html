    <h2 class="b margin">Introduction</h2>
    <p class="text-color margin">
    The goal of this project is to analyze the cost of living using a machine learning model. The project aims to develop and optimize a predictive model that can estimate the cost of living based on various features. This could help clients or employers with numerous things but mostly for aid in compensation planning for future employees based on location.

    <h2 class="b margin">Problem Statement: <br>
    Analyzing Cost of Living with Machine Learning</h2>

    <p class="text-color margin">
    The cost of living is a critical factor influencing individuals' economic decisions and well-being. Our project focuses on leveraging machine learning to conduct a comprehensive analysis of the cost of living dataset. The goal is to develop and optimize a predictive model capable of estimating the cost of living based on various features. This endeavor involves data cleaning, normalization, and standardization processes to ensure accurate and reliable predictions. Additionally, the project aims to utilize data from Spark to enhance data processing capabilities, providing a robust foundation for meaningful predictive power. The ultimate objective is to optimize the model, document the iterative changes made, and showcase the overall performance, thereby providing valuable insights into the cost of living dynamics for informed decision-making.
    </p>
    <h2 class="b margin">Additional Information</h2>
    <p class="text-color margin"> The Inflation rate in the past 3 years has increased by 7%. It is currently at the highest its ever been since 1980. Between that time and 2020 it has hovered between 1-5%.
    This marks a big change in our society as the cost of living grows higher.
